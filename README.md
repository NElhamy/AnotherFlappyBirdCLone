# Flappy Bird Replica

This is a simple Flappy Bird replica game created using Unity. It serves as a benchmark to track my growth and progress as a game developer.

## Game Description

Flappy Bird Replica is a classic side-scrolling arcade game where the player controls a bird and navigates it through a series of obstacles by pressing a designated key. The goal is to survive for as long as possible without colliding with the pipes. The game features simple controls, pixel art graphics, and an addictive gameplay loop.
